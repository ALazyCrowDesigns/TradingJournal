# TradingJournal — Session Log (2025-09-13)

This document records everything we produced **today** in ChatGPT for the TradingJournal project so it can be checked into the repo for future reference.

**Repo:** https://github.com/ALazyCrowDesigns/TradingJournal.git  
**Scope:** Sprint scaffolding, roadmap, and Phases 1–6 execution guides + Cursor prompts.

---

## What we created today

### 1) Project bootstrap & planning
- **TradingJournal — Sprint 0 → MVP plan (.md)**: step-by-step initial scaffold (venv, tooling, file tree, stubs, tests, GUI).  
- **Cursor Prompt (Claude 4-sonnet) for Sprint 0 → MVP**: hands-off bootstrap inside Cursor.

### 2) Roadmap
- **ROADMAP.md**: ten-phase, end-to-end execution plan with Goals, Tasks, and DoD for each phase.

### 3) Phase execution packs (spec + Cursor prompt)
Each phase below includes a detailed **Markdown spec** and a **Cursor prompt** tailored to Claude 4-sonnet, designed to implement the spec inside your repo.

- **Phase 1 — Data Layer Foundations**  
  Migrations with Alembic, naming conventions, DTOs, DAO batch I/O, migration/constraint tests.

- **Phase 2 — CSV Ingestion (robust & idempotent)**  
  Mapping file, multi-format date parsing, dry-run CLI, diagnostics logging, DB idempotency, tests + goldens.

- **Phase 3 — Market Data & Backfill Orchestrator**  
  Polygon retries/backoff + UTC normalization, contiguous-span backfill, DB-first caching, CLI, tests.

- **Phase 4 — Float & Fundamentals Enrichment**  
  Newer-wins float loader (CSV + CLI), FMP fundamentals hydrator (skip-if-no-key), optional GUI action, tests.

- **Phase 5 — GUI v1: Fast Table You Can Live In**  
  Chunked QAbstractTableModel w/ DB-side sort, filters, column chooser + persisted prefs, non-blocking Import CSV → Backfill flow.

- **Phase 6 — Derived Metrics & Journal Analytics**  
  Derived columns (%Gap, %Range, %CloseChange), analytics panel (hit rate, avg gain/loss, top symbols), Export View, tests.

## How to integrate this into the repo

1. Create folders (if they don’t exist):  
   ```powershell
   mkdir docs\phases
   mkdir docs\cursor
   ```
2. Copy each artifact into the paths in the table above.  
3. Commit:  
   ```powershell
   git add ROADMAP.md docs/
   git commit -m "docs: session log + roadmap + phase specs + cursor prompts"
   git push origin main
   ```

---

## How to use the Phase packs (quick refresher)

In **Cursor** with **Claude 4-sonnet**:
1. Open your repo folder.  
2. Open a Claude tab and paste the matching **Cursor prompt** (e.g., Phase 3).  
3. Paste the **Phase spec** for that phase.  
4. Claude executes the spec (code changes, tests, CLI runs) and pushes a feature branch (e.g., `feature/p3-backfill`).  
5. Open a PR and review.

## Open next steps (not done today)

- Phase 7 — Profiles, Settings, Backup/Restore  
- Phase 8 — Resilience & Performance Hardening  
- Phase 9 — QA/CI + Docs polish & screenshots  
- Phase 10 — Packaging & Release (PyInstaller + GitHub Releases)

---

## Notes & conventions we set today

- Python **3.12**, modern stack: SQLAlchemy 2.0 typed ORM, Alembic, Polars, PySide6, httpx, pydantic-settings.  
- SQLite tuned with WAL & pragmatic PRAGMAs; batch I/O via `bulk_insert_mappings` and dialect-native upserts.  
- DTO boundaries using pydantic v2; mapping-based CSV ingestion with dry-run and structured logging.  
- Backfill is **DB-first** and idempotent (only missing), with retries and a simple circuit breaker.  
- GUI is responsive via chunked DB queries and background workers (QThread).  
- Derived metrics computed in SQL; analytics panel mirrors current filters; CSV export added.
